# ðŸ‘‹ Hello I'm Siddhesh Sawant
I am a passionate software engineer currently pursuing a Master of Science in Information Systems at Northeastern University, Boston. With 2.8 years of experience in the IT industry, including my role as a System Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India, I have worked extensively on financial services and IT consulting projects.

My expertise lies in backend development, system security, and web applications, with a strong foundation in Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python. I have experience working with Spring MVC for backend development, Node.js for scalable server-side applications, React.js for building dynamic user interfaces, and MongoDB for efficient database management.

During my time at TCS, I contributed to Loan Origination Systems (LOS) for the State Bank of India, improving security and efficiency through RESTful APIs, encryption techniques (AES, RSA), and digital signatures (SHA-256). My ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams and optimize financial technology systems has strengthened my problem-solving skills and technical expertise.

I am passionate about building secure, high-performance applications, exploring emerging technologies, and delivering innovative solutions that align with business objectives. I thrive on solving complex challenges, fostering strong professional relationships, and continuously learning to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. ðŸš€

I'm always eager to connect with motivated, hard-working, and talented professionals. Feel free to reach out to me at sawant.sidd@northeastern.edu or send a connection request!
